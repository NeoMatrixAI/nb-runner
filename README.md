# nb-runner

This repository is a notebook runner composed of `.ipynb` and `.py` files.

It is primarily designed to run in a local environment such as **Google Colab**.  
If you adjust the "Mount Google Drive" cell and specify your **personal path**, it can be easily adapted to other local environments as well.

To use the provided API functions, you must obtain a `data apikey` and `user key` from **NeoMatrix**.

You can run backtests and live trading using either:
- your own custom strategies and configuration files, or  
- the regularly updated strategies and settings shared via the [strategy repository](https://github.com/NeoMatrixAI/strategy).

For questions or support, please reach out via the [**NeoMatrix Discord**](https://discord.gg/n6tMdrse)
